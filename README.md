# To Do List App

### This project is similar to 'kanban' Boards

An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to learn and practice:
- OOP Principles
- SOLID principles
- ES6 Modules
- Dynamic Updating of ```localStorage``` both read and write
### Update:
- Complete rebuild of project using React, TypeScript, Styled Components, useReducer and useContext hooks

### Things I learned:
- Public field declarations for code readability
- OOP Principles
- SOLID Design
- Color Palette design 
- Deep Cloning Objects when calling them back into application from ```localStorage```
- The benefits / downsides of 'deep' vs 'shallow' cloning
- Troubleshooting ```localStorage``` array objects as they can get inverted when being written to memory
- Compartmentalization and the use of 'handler' functions to separate code functionality

### Note:
This project is not yet complete, the scope of it got out of hand and has to be refactored down from the kanban board
to a more simple to do list. The version hosted in the ```gh-pages``` branch is not reflective of the final project state.
