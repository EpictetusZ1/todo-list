## Description
An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

### Update:

##### A *complete rebuild* of the project has been done using:
- React (useReducer and useContext hooks)
- TypeScript
- Firebase:
   - Firestore Database
   - Authentication via Google Auth. provider
- Styled Components

## Functionality

- Create projects in which to organize your 'To Dos'
- Create and store a list of 'To Do Items', sorted by project, then status
- Change status of 'To Do Item'
- Option to choose Firebase - to store your data in the could or ```localStorage```
- Data persistence on both storage options
- Preform all CRUD operations on 'To Dos'

## Things I Learned

#### On refactor to React / TypeScript:

- Defining object "shapes" with `interfaces`
- TypeScript best practices
- Styled components `Global styles`
- React Hooks: `useContext()` and `useReducer()` to provide global state management store (single source of truth)
- Firestore integration as a backend or BaaS (Backend as a Service)
- Google authentication to allow users access to their unique data in an easy and secure way

#### On first version:

- Public field declarations for code readability
- OOP Principles
- SOLID Design
- Color Palette design
- Deep Cloning of objects when retrieving from ```localStorage```
- The benefits / downsides of 'deep' vs 'shallow' cloning
- Troubleshooting ```localStorage``` arrays as they can get inverted when being written to memory
- Compartmentalization and the use of 'handler' functions to separate code functionality
