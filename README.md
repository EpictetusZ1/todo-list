# To Do List Main

### A To Do Main done in the style of 'kanban' Boards

### An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

#### Update:
- A complete rebuild of project has been done using:
  - React (useReducer and useContext hooks)
  - TypeScript
  - Styled Components
  - Firebase


### Things I learned:
- Public field declarations for code readability
- OOP Principles
- SOLID Design
- Color Palette design 
- Deep Cloning Objects when calling them back into application from ```localStorage```
- The benefits / downsides of 'deep' vs 'shallow' cloning
- Troubleshooting ```localStorage``` array objects as they can get inverted when being written to memory
- Compartmentalization and the use of 'handler' functions to separate code functionality

#### First iteration was aimed at learning:
- OOP Principles
- SOLID principles
- ES6 Modules
- Dynamic Updating of ```localStorage``` both read and write
